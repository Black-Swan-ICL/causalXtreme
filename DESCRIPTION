Description: Functions for causal structure learning based on the paper 
    "Causality in Heavy-Tailed Models" from Gnecco, N., Meinshausen, N.,
    Peters, J., and, Engelke, S. Extremal ancestral search (EASE) is the main
    algorithm algorithm to recover the causal order of a heavy-tailed 
    structural causal model (SCM). to compare EASE with other methods,
    we provide wrapper functions around LiNGAM-ICA, PC and PC-Rank algorithm.
