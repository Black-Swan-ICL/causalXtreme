Description: Functions for causal structure learning based on the paper 
    "Causality in Heavy-Tailed Models" from Gnecco, N., Meinshausen, N.,
    Peters, J., and, Engelke, S. The main algorithm for causal structure
    learning is greedy ancestral search that is suited when the data are
    generated by a structural causal model (SCM) with heavy-tailed noise.
    To compare greedy ancestral search with other methods,
    wrappers around LiNGAM-ICA, PC and PC-Rank algorithm from are provided.
