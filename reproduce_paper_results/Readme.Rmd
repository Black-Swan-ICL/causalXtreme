This folder contains the files to replicate the simulations and real-world experiments
of @gne2019 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05097].

A brief introduction to the `causalXtreme` package can be found at https://nicolagnecco.github.io/causalXtreme.

The required R packages are: `causalXtreme`, `tidyverse`, `tidyquant`, `doParallel`, `doRNG`,
`rngtools`, `tictoc`, `latex2exp`, `tools`, `kableExtra`, `cowplot`, `evd`, `evir`,
`Hmisc`, `timetk`, `tsibble`, `reshape2`, `ismev`, and `pracma`.

This folder contains the following files:

* `main.R`, which runs all the `R` files to produce the results and figures of Sections 5.1â€“5.3
* `simulation_0.R`, ..., `simulation_3.R`, which reproduce results of Section 5.1
* `simulation_functions.R`, which contains all the helper functions for results of Section 5.1
* `produce_charts.R`, which reproduces all figures of Section 5.1
* `financial_data.R`, which reproduces all results and figures of Section 5.2
* `river_map.R`, which reproduces the river map of Section 5.3
* `river_data.R`, which reproduces all remaining results and figures of Section 5.3

It also contains the following folders:

* `data`, which contains the raw data for the financial and river data experiments
* `original_output`, which contains the output of simulations of Section 5.1.
These simulations can be reproduced using `main.R`, but they are computationally intensive
* `output`, which is an empty folder for the results produced by `main.R`

<span style="color: brown;">**Warning**</span>: in order to run `main.R` set the working directory to `/reproduce_paper_results`.
